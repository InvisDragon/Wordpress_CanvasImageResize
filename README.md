Resizes images in Wordpress BEFORE uploading them.

== Description ==

If you host your site in a very poor environment, Wordpress may fail uploading large images as the process of creating the different sizes and thumnails takes a large amount of cpu usage.
With this Plugin the images are simply resized to a maximum dimension of 1600x1600 right in your browser before uploading them.
The nice side effect is that unneccessary big images are resized to a fine size to still provide a usable, qualitative image.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder "canvas-image-resize" to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your installation, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
